An MPhil student at the School of Data Science, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shen Zhen. I pursued a Bachelor's degree in the School of Science and Engineering, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shen Zhen.

I am interested in applications of abstraction/approximation methods in software engineering related to static program analysis, program optimization, and testing.
