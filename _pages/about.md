Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science, Nanjing University (NJU), supervised by Professor Qingkai Shi. I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Computer Science from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.

My research interests focus on the application of abstraction and approximation techniques in static program analysis, program optimization, and software testing.
