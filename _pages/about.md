PhD student at the School of Computer Science, Nanjing University (NJU), under the guidance of Professor Qingkai Shi. I pursued my Bachelor and Master degree in Computer Science at Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shen Zhen.

I am interested in applications of abstraction/approximation methods in software engineering related to static program analysis, program optimization, and testing.
